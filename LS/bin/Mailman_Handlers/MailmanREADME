We are currently using Mailman Version 2.1.9. Mailman is ususally installed in /usr/lib/mailman and lists and data are stored in /var/lib/mailman.
Mailman logs are usually found in /var/log/mailman.

We modfiy two mailman scripts so that they can be used with SELS.

/usr/lib/mailman/Mailman/OldStyleMemberships.py
and 
/usr/lib/mailman/Mailman/Handlers/SMTPDirect.py


1) OldStyleMemberships.py
This script is modified to delete a user and his keys from Mailman. The user can be deleted via the mailman web interface or command line. 

Requires:
SELSdeleteuser.py 
SELSpath.py
mailmanlogs.py
OldStyleMembership.py.patch

Copy these scripts from the SELS code distribution  ~LS/bin/Mailman_Handlers to /usr/lib/mailman/Mailman/

Then apply the patch using

patch -b OldStyleMemberships.py -i OldStyleMemberships.py.patch



2) SMTPDirect.py

This script is modified to add SELS Checkkeyid, transformation and bounce functionality. 

Requires:
SELSsmtphelper.py
mailmanlogs.py
mailmanlistpath.py
SELSpath.py
GnuPGInterface.py
SMTPDirect.py.patch

Additionally SELS.py is a standalone SELS Handler and should also go in the Mailman Handlers directory

Copy these scripts from the SELS code distribution , ~LS/bin/Mailman_Handlers to /usr/lib/mailman/Mailman/Handlers
 
Then apply the patch using

patch -b SMTPDirect.py -i SMTPDirect.py.patch


3) To add  SELS.py  to the global Mailman PIPELINE refer to INSTALL instructions in the code distrbution.


4) Then restart mailman using 
/usr/lib/mailman/bin/mailmanctl stop
/usr/lib/mailman/bin/mailmanctl start
	 


Note: This patch works with Mailman v 2.1.9. We expect it to work for future versions of Mailman. Remember to patch the 
files again after a Mailman update. 
If for some reason the patch fails please contact the SELS Team. To do so, go to http://sels.ncsa.uiuc.edu/support.html
